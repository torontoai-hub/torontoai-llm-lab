What does this Python code print? print('Hello' + ' World'),Hello World,coding,"This Python code prints:

```
Hello World
```

The `+` operator is used for concatenation in Python, not string addition. This means that it combines the two strings into a single string without performing any mathematical operations on them. 

It's worth noting that in Python 3.x, you can use the `str.join()` method or f-strings to achieve similar results:

```python
print('Hello'.join([' ' + 'World']))
# or
print(f'Hello {''} World')
```

However, the original code will still work as expected and print `'Hello World'`.",1.9375238418579102,0.0,47.81818181818182
"In Python, what is the value of True and False?",False,coding,"In Python, `True` and `False` are boolean values.

The value of `True` is equivalent to 1 in numerical operations and the value of `False` is equivalent to 0. This means that you can use them as numbers in mathematical expressions:

```python
print(1 == True)  # Output: True
print(0 == False)  # Output: True
```

Additionally, boolean values are also used in conditional statements like if-else and for loops.

Here's an example of using `True` and `False` in a simple if statement:

```python
x = True
if x:
    print(""x is true"")
else:
    print(""x is false"")

# Output: x is true
```

In this example, the condition `x` is evaluated as `True`, so the code inside the `if` block runs.",2.783522844314575,0.0,137.6
"What is the output of [1,2,3][1] in Python?",2,coding,"In Python, when you use square brackets `[]` to access an element from a list, it first looks for that index within the innermost set of brackets.

The output of `[1,2,3][1]` is `2`.",1.3790457248687744,0.0,281.0
