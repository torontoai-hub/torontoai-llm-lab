What is the plural of 'child'?,children,language,"The plural form of ""child"" can be used in different ways, depending on the context:

1. In most cases, when referring to multiple children, the plural form is simply ""children"". (e.g., ""I have three children."")
2. When referring to a group of people who are considered to be like children, such as students or young adults, the plural form can be ""children"" (e.g., ""The university is full of children"").
3. In some cases, especially when referring to specific individuals, the word ""child"" itself can remain in the singular form, with no change in spelling. (e.g., ""My child is coming over for dinner."")

However, it's worth noting that in British English, the preferred plural form is often ""children"", while in American English, both forms (""children"" and ""childs"") are commonly used.

So, to summarize: when referring to multiple children or groups of people considered like children, use ""children"".",3.1014931201934814,0.0,112.875

What does this Python code print? print('Hello' + ' World'),Hello World,coding,"This Python code prints:

'HeloWorld'

Explanation:
In Python, when you use the `+` operator to concatenate two strings, it doesn't automatically insert a space between them. This is because the default behavior for string concatenation in Python is to perform an ""atomic"" operation, which means that all the characters are concatenated together without any separation.

To print 'Hello World', you would need to use string formatting or concatenation with spaces, like this:

```python
print('Hello ' + 'World')
```

or

```python
print('Hello' + ' World')
```",2.0620479583740234,0.0,51.0
"In Python, what is the value of True and False?",False,coding,"In Python, the values of `True` and `False` are as follows:

- `True` is equivalent to the boolean value ""true"" in other languages
- `False` is equivalent to the boolean value ""false"" in other languages

However, internally, Python stores these values as integers.

- `True` is stored as 1
- `False` is stored as 0

This means that you can use the `int()` function to convert a boolean value into an integer:

```python
print(int(True))  # Outputs: 1
print(int(False))  # Outputs: 0
```

Also, note that in Python, you cannot directly assign an integer value of 0 or 1 to a boolean variable. You need to use the boolean functions `bool()` or the logical operators `==` and `!=`, as shown below:

```python
# Not allowed
x = 0

# Allows conversion of integers into booleans
y = bool(0)
print(y)  # Outputs: False

z = True
print(int(z))  # Outputs: 1
```

The use of the boolean functions `bool()` and the logical operators `==` and `!=` are generally recommended over direct assignment to avoid potential issues.",4.309241056442261,0.0,202.4
"What is the output of [1,2,3][1] in Python?",2,coding,"In Python, when you use square brackets to index a list, it returns the value at that index.

So, if we have a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3]` and we do `[my_list[1]]`, the output would be `2`.

However, in your question, you have written `[1,2,3][1]`. This is incorrect syntax. The correct way to write this would be `[1,2,3][1] = [1,2,3][1]` or simply `my_list[1]`.

If we do `[1, 2, 3][1]`, Python will throw a `TypeError` because you can't use the square brackets on a list like that.

So, to answer your question, if you meant to write it as `[1,2,3][1] = [1,2,3][1]`, the output would be `2`.",3.1952688694000244,0.0,593.0
