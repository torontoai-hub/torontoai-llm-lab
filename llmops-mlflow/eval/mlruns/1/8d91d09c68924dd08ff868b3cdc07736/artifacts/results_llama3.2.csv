"If x + 5 = 12, what is x?",7,math,"To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x.

Given equation: x + 5 = 12

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5
x = 7

So, the value of x is 7.",1.0700552463531494,0.0,175.0

Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?,William Shakespeare,knowledge,"The authorship of 'Romeo and Juliet' is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars. While William Shakespeare is commonly credited with writing the play, there are some theories suggesting that it may have been written by another playwright or even an Italian poet named Arthur Brooke.

However, most experts agree that the final version of 'Romeo and Juliet' was indeed written by William Shakespeare, who was active in London from around 1592 to 1613. The play is believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, during the English Renaissance period.

It's worth noting that some scholars argue that the story of Romeo and Juliet may have been inspired by a narrative poem called ""The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet"" by Arthur Brooke, which was published in 1562. However, Shakespeare's version of the play is significantly different from Brooke's poem, with many unique elements, characters, and plot developments that are distinctive to Shakespeare's work.

In any case, William Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the greatest playwrights in history, and 'Romeo and Juliet' remains one of his most iconic and enduring works.",3.7063519954681396,0.0,60.21052631578947

What is the plural of 'child'?,children,language,"The plural form of ""child"" can be a bit tricky. There are actually two commonly accepted options:

1. Children
2. Kids (informal) or Minors (more formal)

In general, if you're referring to multiple children in a specific context or situation, the first option is usually the most suitable choice. However, if you're writing in an informal tone or addressing group of younger people, ""kids"" might be more appropriate.

It's worth noting that some style guides, like the Chicago Manual of Style, recommend using ""children"" as the preferred plural form when referring to multiple young individuals, while others, like AP Stylebook, suggest ""kids"" for informal contexts. Ultimately, the choice depends on your context, tone, and intended audience.",2.4435670375823975,0.0,93.0

Is this sentence in past tense: 'She will dance'?,no,language,"No, the sentence ""She will dance"" is not in the past tense. It's actually in the future tense or more specifically, the conditional tense (also known as the modal verb tense). The auxiliary verb ""will"" indicates that the action of dancing is expected to happen at a later time.

If you want to express the same idea in the past tense, you would need to rephrase it. For example:

* ""She danced.""
* ""She had danced.""

What does this Python code print? print('Hello' + ' World'),Hello World,coding,"This Python code prints:

'Hello World'

The `+` operator in Python is used for string concatenation. So, when you concatenate two strings using the `+` operator, it returns a new string that is the result of combining the individual characters from each string.

In this case, `'Hello'` and `' World'` are concatenated together to form the final output `'Hello World'`.",1.3234961032867432,0.0,33.63636363636363
"In Python, what is the value of True and False?",False,coding,"In Python, `True` and `False` are boolean values. They have specific meanings:

- `True`: represents a true condition or statement.
- `False`: represents a false condition or statement.

These booleans can be used in conditional statements (like if/else) to make decisions based on conditions.",1.0598390102386475,0.0,58.6
"What is the output of [1,2,3][1] in Python?",2,coding,"In Python, when you use square brackets to access an element from a list (or any sequence), it works as follows:

- If the index is within the valid range, it returns the corresponding element.

However, if you try to use square brackets on a single value (like a list of length 1 or less), it will return the object itself. So in your case:

```python
my_list = [1,2,3]
print(my_list[1]) # Outputs: 2
```

But if you do `my_list[1]` which is equivalent to `[my_list][1]`, it works slightly differently.

In Python, when you use square brackets on an object that has a `__getitem__` method defined, like lists or tuples, the bracket notation `obj[index]` calls this method. 

So if we define `my_list[0]` as a custom class with a `__getitem__` method:

```python
class CustomList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        print(f""Getting element at index {index}: {self.value}"")
        return self.value

my_list = CustomList(1)
print(my_list[0]) # Outputs: Getting element at index 0: 1
```

However, if you define this as `[1]`, it will still work:

```python
custom_list_object = CustomList(1)
print(custom_list_object[1]) # Outputs: Getting element at index 1: 1
```

But the correct way to access its first element is by using the `[]` notation on a list:

```python
my_list = [CustomList(1)]
print(my_list[0].value) # Outputs: 1
